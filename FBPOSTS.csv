37,3,"in fact, in a resurrected, otherwise perfected body, our Lord of this sacrament table has chosen to retain for the benefit of his disciples the wounds in his hands and his feet and his side--signs, if you will, that painful things happen even to the pure and perfect. Signs, if you will, that pain in this world is not evidence that God doesn t love you. It is the wounded Christ who is the captain of our soul--he who yet bears the scars of sacrifice, the lesions of love and humility and forgiveness."
